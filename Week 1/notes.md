### Notes
Here are my notes that are helpful, commands or anything
1. To remove a directory from the command line we can use the command:
```bash
    rm <name of file>
```
2. To list all the files in the directory in which we are we can use the command:
```bash
    ls
```
this will list all the files that are in the directory
3. To compile the C program you have to use compiler to convert your source code into machine code, you can do it using the command:
```bash
    make <name of program>
```
if there's no error in your code, this will generates a machine code in your current directory with the name of the file, then you can run it or open it using command:
```bash
    ./<name of file>
```
